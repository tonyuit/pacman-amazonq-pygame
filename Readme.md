# ðŸŸ¡ Pac-Man Clone â€“ Built with Amazon Q + Pygame

This is a modern, visually polished version of the classic **Pac-Man** game, built using **Amazon Q** and the **Pygame** library.  
I used Amazon Q to generate the game structure, core logic, and assets support â€” then customized and refined it to make it smoother and more fun.

5. Prompt Used with Amazon Q
Here is the exact prompt I used to generate the base version of this game with Amazon Q:
```
Please create a polished and visually appealing version of the classic Pac-Man game using Python and Pygame. The game should include:
- A maze with walls, pellets, and power-ups
- Player-controlled Pac-Man with smooth movement using arrow keys
- Multiple ghosts with basic AI (chase, scatter)
- Collision detection and scoring
- Game over/win conditions
- Attractive UI, even without external assets
- Optional support for sprites and sound effects
- Modular, well-commented code using classes like Game, Pacman, Ghost, Map, etc.
```
