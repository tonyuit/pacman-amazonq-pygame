# ðŸŸ¡ Pac-Man Clone â€“ Built with Amazon Q + Pygame

This is a modern, visually polished version of the classic **Pac-Man** game, built using **Amazon Q** and the **Pygame** library.  
I used Amazon Q to generate the game structure, core logic, and assets support â€” then customized and refined it to make it smoother and more fun.
